# godot-window-container
Features:
- drag resizing
- drag repositioning
- window icon/title
- window buttons (minimize, maximize, close)

* some nodes will interfere with the resizing detection, to fix this add the node to the group "prevent_resize_block" 
Its not a perfect solution but it should work well enough.
